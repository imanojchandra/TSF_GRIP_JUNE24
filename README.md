### Task 2: Prediction Using Unsupervised Machine Learning


### Project Overview:
In this project, I worked with the Iris dataset to predict the optimum number of clusters using unsupervised learning techniques. The main goal was to explore and visualize the natural grouping of the Iris data based on the features provided.

### Key Steps and Methodology:
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Imported and cleaned the dataset using Python.
   - Conducted initial exploratory data analysis to understand the structure and relationships within the data.

2. **Determining the Optimal Number of Clusters:**
   - Used the elbow method and silhouette analysis to find the best number of clusters.
   - Implemented K-Means clustering to partition the data into meaningful groups.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Created scatter plots to visualize the clustering results.
   - Plotted the clusters along with the actual Iris species to compare the results.

### Key Learnings and Insights:
- **Clustering Analysis:**
  - Identified three distinct clusters within the Iris dataset, which corresponded well with the actual species classifications.
- **Visualization Skills:**
  - Enhanced my ability to visualize complex data insights through scatter plots and cluster visualizations.
- **Unsupervised Learning:**
  - Gained a deeper understanding of unsupervised machine learning techniques and their practical applications.
